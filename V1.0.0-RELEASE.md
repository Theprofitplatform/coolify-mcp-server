## 🎯 Use Cases

### Infrastructure Management
```javascript
// Get complete infrastructure health
const health = await coolify_get_infrastructure_health();
// Returns: servers, apps, databases, services status + recommendations

// Deploy multiple applications in parallel
await coolify_batch_deploy_applications({
  application_uuids: ["uuid-1", "uuid-2", "uuid-3"],
  parallel: true
});
// Result: 3 apps deployed in ~8 seconds (vs 225s sequential)
```

### Security & Compliance
```javascript
// Create API token with specific permissions
await coolify_create_api_token({
  name: "CI/CD Token",
  permissions: ["read", "deploy"]
});

// Get audit logs for compliance
const logs = await coolify_get_audit_logs({
  start_date: "2025-01-01",
  end_date: "2025-01-31"
});
```

### Monitoring & Alerts
```javascript
// Create custom alert rule
await coolify_create_alert_rule({
  name: "High CPU Alert",
  metric: "cpu_usage",
  threshold: 80,
  channels: ["email", "slack"]
});

// Get deployment statistics
const stats = await coolify_get_deployment_statistics({
  period: "30d"
});
// Returns: success rate, avg time, trends, top apps
```

### Advanced Deployment
```javascript
// Create preview deployment from PR
await coolify_create_preview_deployment({
  application_uuid: "app-uuid",
  pull_request_id: 123,
  auto_deploy: true
});

// Configure build with custom args
await coolify_update_build_configuration({
  application_uuid: "app-uuid",
  build_args: {
    NODE_ENV: "production",
    API_URL: "https://api.example.com"
  },
  cache_enabled: true
});
```
