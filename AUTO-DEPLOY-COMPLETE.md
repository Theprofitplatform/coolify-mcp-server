## 🎓 Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Your First Application

```bash
# Run the setup script
./scripts/setup-auto-deploy.sh your-app-name

# Follow the instructions output by the script
```

### 2. Import N8N Workflow

Choose one:
- **Simple:** Basic deployment (recommended for testing)
- **Advanced:** Health checks + rollback (recommended for production)

### 3. Test the Setup

```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Test auto-deploy" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify auto-deploy"
git push origin develop  # or main

# Watch it deploy
# N8N: https://n8n.theprofitplatform.com.au
# Coolify: https://coolify.theprofitplatform.com.au
```

### 4. Enable for More Applications

The setup script can be run multiple times:

## 🔧 Configuration Examples

### Production (Safe)
```json
{
  "production": {
    "force_rebuild": true,      // Full rebuild
    "run_tests": true,          // Run tests first
    "health_check": true,       // Verify after deploy
    "auto_rollback_on_failure": true
  }
}
```

### Staging (Fast)
```json
{
  "staging": {
    "force_rebuild": false,     // Use cache
    "run_tests": true,          // Still test
    "health_check": true        // Quick check
  }
}
```

### Development (Fastest)
```json
{
  "development": {
    "force_rebuild": false,     // Use cache
    "run_tests": false,         // Skip tests
    "health_check": false       // No checks
  }

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnostics

```bash
# Test API connection
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ***REMOVED***" \
     https://coolify.theprofitplatform.com.au/api/v1/version

# Test webhook
curl -X POST https://n8n.theprofitplatform.com.au/webhook/github-deploy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ref":"refs/heads/main","repository":{"name":"test"}}'

# Check N8N executions
open https://n8n.theprofitplatform.com.au/executions

# Check Coolify deployments
open https://coolify.theprofitplatform.com.au
```

### Common Issues

**Webhook not triggering?**
- Check N8N workflow is active
- Verify webhook URL in GitHub matches N8N
- Look for green checkmark next to webhook in GitHub

**Deployment fails?**
- Verify application UUID is correct
- Check API token has permissions
- Review Coolify deployment logs

**Health check fails?**
- Add `/health` endpoint to your app
- Or disable health checks in config
